Hello everyone,

A couple weeks ago some of us spent a morning gardening at [Plant a Kiss, Plant a Tree][Plant a Kiss, Plant a Tree] in some excellent weather before it got chilly, and now it's time for our annual **Christmas Shoebox Event** again! Last year we packed 135 shoeboxes distributed to children across 15 countries. We are hoping to do same this year, and looking forward to see all of you!

Here are the details for this Christmas:

> [**Date:** NOVEMBER 18, 2017 (Saturday)<br />**Time:** 1pm – 4pm (Light snacks and refreshments will be served)<br />**Location:** Condo Party Room in Building A, 376 Highway 7 East, Markham, ON][ical]
 
**Our Ask:**

Bring yourselves and bring your own shoebox items. Each box will cost a minimum of $10 to ship. We welcome other monetary donations to cover shipping costs. We will also provide some items for you to place in your box, so don't worry! To reiterate some ideas for your shoebox and the things to *not* include...
 
Fill your shoebox with a well-balanced variety of items from the following categories:

+ **School Supplies**–Items such as pencils, pens, pencil crayons, note pads, and picture books
+ **Toys & Other Gifts**–Items such as stuffed animals, small musical instruments, hair clips, toy jewelry, t-shirts and socks
+ **Hygiene Items**–Items such as facecloth, toothbrush, comb, and soap. Please place soap in a sealable bag
+ **Personal Note**–Include a personal note and/or a photo in your shoebox (not inside the donation envelope)
 
DO NOT INCLUDE:

+ Toothpaste (due to customs regulations)
+ No Candy or Food
+ Used items (due to customs regulations)
+ Playing cards (other card games such as UNO are allowed)
+ Liquids or items that could leak, melt, freeze, or break - Shampoo, creams, lip balm, bath gels, mirrors, or glass, etc. (these can damage other items in the shoe box)
+ Items that can scare or harm a child - War-related toys, knives, and toy guns, etc.
+ Using a backpack instead of a shoebox is problematic because it creates unfair circumstances at distribution events. Backpacks can also cause problems when cartons are being packed, and when shipments are going through Customs
 
Please respond with the number of people in your party and the number of shoeboxes you would like to make before **NOVEMBER 1, 2017**, and pass the event along! Thank you :)

*for the Love of Ev*
