Summer is here and we are ready to announce our next ftLoE event! This time we have selected to help at the [Ronald McDonald House Charities (RMHC)][Ronald McDonald House Charities (RMHC)] – [Home For Dinner program][Home For Dinner program]. Their mandate is to provide a *home away from home* for families of seriously ill children to heal better together. We believe that this event definitely aligns with what we believe in.

**Event Details:**

> [**Date:** AUGUST 7, 2016 (Sunday)<br />**Time:** 3pm – 9pm<br />**Location:** Ronald McDonald House Charities<br />@ 240 McCaul Street, Toronto, ON M5T 1W5][ical]

**The Plan:**

We will need to plan and prepare dinner, drinks and dessert for the whole house, which is for approximately 135 people! (WOW!) PLUS don’t forget that we need to clean up as well.

Unfortunately there is a maximum of 20 volunteers for this event, so please email June ([june.au@live.ca][june.au@live.ca]) to RSVP as soon as possible. We know this may result in people not having the chance to participate but we promise if this event is a success, we will definitely be repeating it again!

Once we have our set number of volunteers, we will then send out more information and details about the event.

Thank you,

*for the Love of Ev*
