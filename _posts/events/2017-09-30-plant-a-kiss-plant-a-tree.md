Hello everyone!

We hope all of you are enjoying your summer! September is just a month away and we wanted to have an outdoor event before it gets too cold.  After exploring various options, we thought tree planting would be a fun event for all ages and would be the perfect choice to remember Ev since one of her favourite books for her kids was [Plant a Kiss – by Amy Krouse Rosenthal][Plant a Kiss – by Amy Krouse Rosenthal]. Let’s all gather together to plant new trees and shrubs so that they can help create _endless bliss_ for everyone, just like Little Miss in the book!
